# original nokia snake game in c++

i recently got into c++ so i figured this might be a good start.the main game is tested only on my device 
so use the max compatibility build if you have a different system.this is my first ever c++ project so dont hate 
i know the code isnt the best but it works xd.if u decide to compile my shitty game then have fun lol

#max compatibility version
the game is the same as the main file but you need to type out your controlls and then press enter
like this: w *enter*
