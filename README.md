# original nokia snake game in c++

i recently got into c++ so i figured this might be a good start. The main game is tested only on my device 
so use the max compatibility build if you arent going to play on my pc. This is my first ever c++ project so please be polite
and no need to make a post on r/badcode. If u decide to compile my shitty game then have fun lol

# max compatibility version
the game is the same as the main file but you need to type out your controlls and then press enter
like this: w *enter*
